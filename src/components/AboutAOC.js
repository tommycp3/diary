                    <h2>What is Consensus?</h2>
                    <p>Well according to the Merriam Webster dictionary:</p>
                    <p>Consensus is "an agreement"</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Expanding on this definition, AOC will take a fresh look at this mechanism
                        "consensus" through the eyes of new blockchain capabilitis, and this course
                        will hold you by the hand every step of the way.
                        This mechanism "consensus" is important because its how we can get:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Governments to trust eachother (preventing wars).</li>
                        <li>Government departments to trust each other.</li>
                        <li>Banks to trust each other</li>
                        <li>Mend the devide between corporations, governments and it's citizens.</li>
                        <li>And truely live the peer to peer dream where we treat each other as equals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Fundamentally, we are dealing with the erosion of trust in our fragile society.</p>
